# BMI_Calculator_Using _flutter

### About:
- This is a BMI calculator which is quite helpful to keep tracking your BMI and also help to give you suggestions based on the performance (what is the range of BMI category you fall). I will also try to improve it based on feedback provided by customers in the coming future and ready to collab with extrenals as well.
